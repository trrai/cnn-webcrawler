The extra credits for this assignment is where I spent a large majority of time and I believe it drastically improved the user experience associated with the project. First, I aimed for the beautiful search results page requirement by incorporating elements that improved aesthetics. I began by changing my crawling code so it would index both the image and body text of the articles it would crawl. CNN was very user-friendly with this process and I was easily able to grab information from the metadata on each url. After storing these two elements, I changed my front end to render a bootstrap card that includes the title, image, publishing date, body text preview, and link to visit the full article for each returned result. I found that incorporating the body text preview and image with each result drastically improves usability and makes parsing the results a lot more efficient. To further improve usability of my project, I incorporated a loading animation that appears when the submit button is clicked and turned hidden after the ajax request is returned. In addition, if a user searches something that is not associated to any results in the table, an image is displayed letting them know. All in all, front end design was completed largely through the Bootstrap library and making use of UX design choices for color and layout. My second extra credit implementation comes in the form of bolding query words in the body text. Since I already had access to the body text after modifying my web crawler, I used regex to find case insensitive occurrences of keywords and replaced the instances with the word surrounded with <b> tags. This process took minimal effort but was immensely rewarding in terms of user experience. Seeing the words that were searched for drastically improves ability to parse results.
